# Contributing to Sentinel Vision

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sentinel Vision! This project aims to make schools safer through AI-powered threat detection, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## ü§ñ Development Philosophy

**Transparency First**: This project embraces AI-assisted development as a modern approach to coding. The project lead handled project management, system architecture, and ethical considerations, while using AI tools to help with implementation. We believe in being open about this approach - it's the future of development!

**Human Oversight**: While AI helps with coding, all critical decisions about school safety, system design, and deployment strategy are made by human judgment. This ensures responsible AI deployment in sensitive environments.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of computer vision and machine learning
- Familiarity with YOLOv5 (helpful but not required)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentinel-vision.git
   cd sentinel-vision
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly
- Ensure the system works with different camera setups
- Verify emergency sequences function correctly
- Test both CPU and GPU inference (if applicable)

### Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Follow security best practices for school environments
- Consider privacy implications of any changes
- Maintain human oversight over AI-generated code
- Ensure all safety-critical features are thoroughly tested by humans

## üîí Security and Privacy

### Important Notes

- **No Real 911 Calls**: This is a simulation system for demonstration
- **Local Processing**: All detection occurs on-premises
- **Data Protection**: Respect student and staff privacy
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local school safety regulations

### When Contributing

- Avoid adding external API calls without proper security review
- Ensure any new features maintain privacy standards
- Consider the impact on school safety protocols
- Test thoroughly in controlled environments
